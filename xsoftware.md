## HPC Development Using C++ and SYCL

SYCL is a programming model that targets a wide variety of devices
(CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and more) from a single code base. SYCL supports a
single-source style of programming from completely standard C++. With
increasingly heterogeneous processor roadmaps, a platform-independent
model such as SYCL is essential for software developers.

In this tutorial, we introduce SYCL and also help developers
understand how to migrate code from CUDA to SYCL. The tutorial is
constructed around hands-on exercises that will help reinforce the
concepts presented during the session.

### Software workshop 1: "SYCL" 7-8 January 2021

The Excalibur DDWG for System-Level Engineering will be holding a
Software Training Workshop on 7-8 January 2021, hosted by Codeplay
Software Ltd. Sessions will run for two days, in the afternoons only.

### Software workshop "SYCL" 17 February 2021

The Excalibur DDWG for System-Level Engineering will be holding a
second Software Training Workshop on 17 February 2021, hosted by Codeplay
Software Ltd. The session with run from 13:00-16:00.
This tutorial follows on from the previous one, where we introduced SYCL.
The tutorial is constructed around hands-on exercises that will help reinforce the
concepts presented during the session.
