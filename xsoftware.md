Software development is an important part of the Excalibur-SLE Design and Development Working Group.
As well as writing our own Open Source code, which tests some of the
concepts needed for Exascale, we have run a training workshop on C++/SYCL.

### Code Projects

Public repositories of the software projects that we have been working
on for Excalibur-SLE are available on
[Github](https://github.com/Excalibur-SLE).

### Software workshop: "SYCL" 7 January 2021, 17 February 2021

SYCL is a programming model that targets a wide variety of devices
(CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and more) from a single code base. SYCL supports a
single-source style of programming from completely standard C++. With
increasingly heterogeneous processor roadmaps, a platform-independent
model such as SYCL is essential for software developers.

The Excalibur DDWG for System-Level Engineering held a
Software Training Workshop on 7 January 2021 and 17 February 2021,
hosted by Codeplay Software Ltd. In this tutorial, we introduce SYCL and also help developers
understand how to migrate code from CUDA to SYCL. The tutorial was
constructed around hands-on exercises that help reinforce the concepts
presented during the session.
