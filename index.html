## Exascale Computing for System-Level Engineering
### Design, Optimisation and Resilience

Exascale Computing for System-Level Engineering is funded by
[EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org) and is a collaboration between
researchers and developers at the following UK institutions, led by
University of Cambridge and University College London: University of
Manchester, University of Bristol, University of Edinburgh, Hartree
Centre. We also have partnerships with Intel, Codeplay Software Ltd,
Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, NSCC-Wuxi, RIKEN, University of
Colorado and University of Luxembourg.

### Introduction

The arrival of exascale computers will open new frontiers in our
ability to simulate highly complex engineered and natural
systems. This will create new opportunities for the design and
optimisation of new, highly integrated engineered systems for the
future. It will also allow the development of 'digital twins' of
complex natural systems, such has the human body and coastal/river
regions, that will allow exploration and management of engineering-led
interventions in personalised healthcare and the natural environment.

The exascale computers of the future will be highly parallel with
hundreds of thousands, or millions of processes, working
collectively. Exploiting this remarkable level of parallelism will
require dramatic advances in the mathematics, numerical methods,
software engineering and software tools that underpin simulation, and
will depend on experts in each of these areas coming together. The
simulation of the different but tightly coupled physical processes
that characterise complex engineered and natural systems poses the
additional challenges of coordinating the simulation of multiple
processes, such as the noise created by an airflow flow around a
moving structure under the influence of a magnetic field, or the
fluid, solid, electrical and chemical interactions a human body.

This project brings together working groups of experts from computer
science, mathematics and engineering to address the challenge of how
to simulate coupled physical process at a system level on future
exascale systems. It will also address how to integrate into the
simulation process the vast quantity of data that can be collected
from real systems, how to assess uncertainties and how to interpret
the vast quantities of data that exascale simulations will
generate. The working group will formulate roadmaps for enabling
research for exascale computing, and support research software
engineer training for exascale-ready software skills.
