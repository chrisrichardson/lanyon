title: "Workshop III: Towards Exascale Simulation of Integrated Engineering Systems"
---

The imminent deployment of exascale computing will usher in a new era
of engineering system prediction, design and optimisation. It would
enable a whole-system approach in a seamless fashion that
significantly cuts the development cycle and cost. Before such a full
potential can be realised, a fundamental rethink is needed about
how we construct physical models and application software codes for
the new computer architectures and software libraries. Sophisticated
engineering systems typically involve multi-physical processes, such
as flow, heat transfer, chemical reactions, electromagnetics,
acoustics, and fluid-structure interaction, often in complex
geometries. Spatial scales can span 9-12 orders of magnitude and the
range of temporal scales can be even wider. In most cases, computer
codes have been developed and optimised for specific applications with
a limited range of time and length scales. The corresponding models
and numerical methods pose different challenges on exascale
computers. How to integrate existing methods and/or develop completely
new methods to make full use of exascale computing is a grand
challenge for mathematicians, physicists, computer scientist as well
as engineers. In this workshop, leading experts in the field will
showcase recent efforts in the development of modelling methodologies,
computer algorithms, software interfaces, and software/hardware
co-design in preparation for the arrival of exascale
computing. Cutting-edge simulations of engineering systems at extreme
time and length scales will be demonstrated. Finally, existing gaps
and remaining issues will be identified to stimulate further
discussions and actions in the field.

### Peter Coveney (UCL, UK): Applications and challenges for systems engineering on the road to the exascale

#### Abstract

In this talk I will highlight some of the work that we are doing within the Centre for Computational Science at UCL that is enabling practical evaluation of several of the current globally leading multi-petascale HPC facilities in preparation for the advent of exascale machines. This work includes simulations at the bleeding edge for applications in cardiovascular blood flow, materials design and drug discovery.
Uncertainty quantification is an essential element in the development of actionable engineering solutions using computers. I will illustrate this by discussing an application of the software tools we have developed to assess the uncertainty in an epidemiological model of the COVID-19 pandemic used to advise UK government ahead of the March 2020 lockdown.

### Yvan Fournier (EDF): Continuous evolution of an industrial CFD code for future environments

#### Abstract
As one of the largest electricity production utilities, EDF has made
heavy use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for many
years, both to study improvements to various production means (from
nuclear to wind), and as a part of safety studies around pressurized
water reactors. For most of these applications, EDF has been
continuously developed and maintained the code_saturne CFD solver
since 1997, consolidating experience with older codes. To encourage
and facilitate collaboration, it has been released under a free
software license since 2007.

As with most industrial codes of this type, design must balance ease
of use, robustness, performance, an a wide application and validity
domain, where a tool's life cycle is often longer than thar of many
underlying computing technologies it can use.

Over the years, this has been handled by many incremental code base
evolutions, maintaining features and compatibiliy across several
versions, while rewriting and improving various sub-systems, in a
progressive upgrade cycle.

To keep the user workflow simple and strive for maximum portability
and perfoemance, we have striven over time to ensure as many pre and
post-processing operations as possible are integrated as steps in the
main distributed parallel run, including several in-situ
post-processing options, and parallel coupling features. This has been
done using a combination of internal library functions based on the
code’s main data structures, and optionally leveraging external
libraries, especially for mesh partitioning and in-situ
post-processing.

We will present several of the latest evolutions related to high
performance computing aspects of code_saturne, both related to in-situ
pre and post-processing, and to the computational models and kernels
that have allowed us to adapt for current compute architectures and
prepare for the future, while keeping a consistent long-term
approach.

### Prof Haohuan Fu (Tsinghua University & National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi): Optimizing CESM-HR on Sunway TaihuLight and An Unprecedented Set of Multi-Century Simulation

#### Abstract

CESM is one of the very first and most complex scientific codes that
gets migrated onto Sunway TaihuLight. Being a community code involving
hundreds of different dynamic, physics, and chemistry processes, CESM
brings severe challenges for the many-core architecture and the
parrallel scale of Sunway TaihuLight. This talk summarizes our
continuous effort on enabling efficient run of CESM on Sunway,
starting from refactoring of CAM in 2015, redesigning of CAM in 2016
and 2017, and a collaborative effort starting in 2018 to enable highly
efficient simulations of the high-resolution (25 km atmosphere and 10
km ocean) Community Earth System Model (CESM-HR) on Sunway
Taihu-Light. The refactoring and optimizing efforts have improved the
simulation speed of CESM-HR from 1 SYPD (simulation years per day) to
5 SYPD (with output disabled). Using CESM-HR, We manage to provide an
unprecedented set of high-resolution climate simulations, consisting
of a 500-year pre-industrial control simulation and a 250-year
historical and future climate simulation from 1850 to 2100. Overall,
high-resolution simulations show significant improvements in
representing global mean temperature changes, seasonal cycle of
sea-surface temperature and mixed layer depth, extreme events and in
relationships between extreme events and climate modes.

simulation in 2017).

### Serge Guillas (UCL, UK): Reduced Order Modelling

#### Abstract

Uncertainty quantification of complex coupled models is done
via building surrogates (known as statistical emulators) that mimic
the input-output relationship, in order to alleviate the computational
burden of running ensembles. However, the complexities of models are
often large so building emulators can be challenging. In this talk, we
discuss strategies to reduce input and output dimensions with little
loss in information, exploiting input sensitivities and output
variability over time or space. We also propose a bespoke
approach for systems of sub-models where emulators can be linked to
achieve large gains in computational efficiency and approximation
accuracy.

### Tzanio Kolev (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory): Efficient Finite Element Discretizations for Exascale Applications

#### Abstract

Exascale architectures require rethinking of the numerical algorithms
used in many large-scale applications. These architectures favor
algorithms that expose fine-grain parallelism and maximize the ratio
of floating point operations to energy intensive data movement. One
of the few viable approaches to achieve high efficiency in the area
of PDE discretizations on unstructured grids is to use
matrix-free/partially-assembled high-order finite element methods to
increase the accuracy and/or lower the computational time due to
reduced data motion.

In this talk we report on recent work in the Center for Efficient
Exascale Discretizations (CEED) [1], a co-design center in the US
Exascale Computing Project that is focused on the development of
next-generation discretization software and algorithms to enable a
wide range of finite element applications to run efficiently on future
hardware. CEED is a research partnership involving 30+ computational
scientists from two US national labs and five universities, including
members of the Nek5000, MFEM [2], MAGMA, OCCA and PETSc projects.

Topics of discussion will include recent progress in CEED packages and
applications, new miniapps, benchmarks and libraries developed in the
project, efficient GPU algorithms, and our efforts in unstructured
adaptive mesh refinement, matrix-free linear solvers and high-order
data analysis and visualization.

### Stephen Longshaw (STFC, DL, SC; UK): General High-Performance Code Coupling

#### Abstract

 In this talk I will describe the open-source Multiscale Universal
 Interface (MUI) code coupling library. A joint development between
 UKRI STFC, Lawrence-Berkeley National Laboratory, IBM Research UK and
 Brown University, MUI is a C++ header-only library that provides a
 simple point-based data transfer paradigm, alongside an extensible
 collection of spatial and temporal sampling algorithms. It is
 designed entirely around the MPI MPMD (Multiple Program Multiple
 Data) concept and offers great potential for use in an HPC
 environment. As example I will also discuss a recent effort using MUI
 to couple a Molecular Dynamics and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
 solver to enable solution of microscopic problems involving gas and
 large simulation domain sizes.

 hardware and HPC and, in particular, how these two interests combine
 to form the new exascale landscape.

### Dr Daniel Lycett-Brown (Dassault Systèmes): Multiscale simulation of multiphase fluid dynamics for engineering applications

#### Abstract

 The computational simulation of fluid dynamics is required across a
 wide range of engineering applications. Here we focus on multiphase
 fluid dynamics using the lattice Boltzmann method, with applications
 ranging from the micron scale (porous media, ink-jet printing,
 lab-on-a-chip etc.) to the meters scale (car wading, offshore wind
 turbines, ship dynamics etc.). Different physics dominates at
 different scales which has led to the development of different
 modelling approaches for different applications. However many
 practical applications bridge a wide range of scales and this
 modelling approach breaks down. We propose solutions to this problem,
 for which exascale computing plays a significant role. Highly
 efficient and scalable codes that can take full advantage of modern
 CPU supercomputers and GPU clusters are allowing simulations with
 higher resolutions than previously possible. Combined with
 technologies for adaptive mesh refinement and effective load
 balancing across MPI processes this will allow a larger range of
 scales to be simulated with acceptable turnaround times. However in
 some circumstances subgrid scale phenomena will still require
 modelling.  Development of models for these subgrid phenomena and
 coupling between models at different scales is required. Exascale
 computing can again play a role; large numbers of high-resolution
 simulations at the microscale can be used to inform these subgrid
 models (for example droplet collision maps can be built up to inform
 spray dynamic models). The combination of new models, coupled across
 time and length scales, and the power of exascale computing will be
 revolutionary in the simulation tools needed to design the
 engineering applications of tomorrow.

### Dr Christopher Maynard (University of Reading and Met Office, UK): Realising Richardson’s dream: Developing modelling capability at Exascale for the Met Office

#### Abstract

The Met Office is developing a new weather and climate
modelling system to exploit Exoscale computing. The atmospheric model
is named LFRic after Lewis Fry Richardson, who first attempted
numerical weather prediction a century ago. The LFRic model is being
co-designed with a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and new scientific
methods, such as communication avoiding algorithms. The DSL allows for
single source science code with parallel code for different
programming models. Some Initial performance results are shown.

### Pierre Sagaut (Aix-Marseille Université): Unsteady simulations of complex turbulent flows using Lattice-Boltzmann Methods

#### Abstract
The presentation deals with recent developments in the design of
Lattice-Boltzmann methods (LBM) for the simulation of turbulent flows
in complex geometries, with a broad range of applications ranging from
urban physics, micrometeorology to aerospace engineering. Two key
issues are addressed, more precisely 1) accounting for realistic
thermodynamics (from perfect gas with compressibility effects to humid
air with phase changes) while optimizing the numerical efficiency of
the method and 2) stabilizing the method while preserving the
low-dispersion/low-dissipation feature of the original LBM method. The
latter point will be addressed within the Scale Resolving Approach for
turbulent flow simulation, and the optimization of the stabilizing
procedure for Implicit LES, explicit LES and hybrid RANS-LES methods
will be discussed. Since LBM is based on the use of Cartesian grids,
the development of efficient immersed boundary techniques along with
the coupling with turbulent wall models is a key issue that will be
illustrated.  During the talk, the emphasis will be put on the Hybrid
Recursive Regularized LBM approach developed at the M2P2 laboratory
that is implemented in the ProLB software.
