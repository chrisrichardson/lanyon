title: "Workshop V: Data Visualisation and Data Flows"
---

## 16-17 June 2021

The traditional workflow ofthe computational engineer or scientist:
simulate, store in full, process later – will no longer be fit for
purpose at exascale and a tighter coupling of simulation and
post-processing codes will be required. Stakeholders at this workshop
will discuss the challenges of visualisation and data flow at exascale
and topics such as: (i) limits of current workflows given roadmaps of
future storage and I/O bandwidth; (ii) prescribed and automated
in-situ data extraction; (iii) in-situ dimension reduction techniques;
(iv) intelligent data compression; interactive analysis of large
ensembles of simulations; and, (v) immersive visualisation using VR
and AR3. Invited speakers will include experts from exascale programs,
open source initiatives, vendors and commercial visualization software
companies. The workshop panels will include practitioners from
industry, government laboratories and academia, who are pioneering
visualisation approaches at the current limits of both simulated and
experimentally measured data flows.
